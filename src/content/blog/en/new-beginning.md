During my university years, I once ran a WeChat Official Account. But due to frustration with content review and other factors, that first account ended with me voluntarily deactivating it.

Later, with AI assistance, I built a personal blog from scratch. After more than 3 years of development, my humble site has gained some readers. The image below shows current Cloudflare traffic data for my site—though many of these visitors are actually AI crawlers, so the real numbers are far lower than what's shown.

I've basically been running this as a labor of love, never considering monetization through Google Ads. As a current graduate student, I haven't felt much financial pressure yet. But after sustaining an idealistic website purely through passion for so long, some fatigue is inevitable.

Next year marks the end of my student life, and I'll inevitably need to start earning my own living. Restarting a WeChat Official Account is one approach—not as a main job, but as a side project to experiment with.

The real Chinese internet is no longer the world of websites you find through Google or Bing—it now exists within the "walled gardens" of major tech giants.

As I once again embrace writing in this authentic Chinese internet space, I'll try to avoid being generic. All my writing will be carefully crafted. This account won't touch any sensitive or rule-violating topics—I'll self-censor accordingly.

I also understand that by publishing on WeChat, my writing becomes training data for Tencent's Hunyuan large language model. This is unavoidable on the public web, and even private platforms can't escape it. I accept this reality.

This account's avatar and name match my WeChat account. Every article published here will have a corresponding original on the public web—click the "Read More" button at the end of each article to jump to the source.

This account mainly shares knowledge about AI, personal tinkering projects, and personal growth insights. I aim to update at least once a week.

A new beginning—let's go!
