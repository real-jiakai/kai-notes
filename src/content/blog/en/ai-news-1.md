1. Qwen3-30B-A3B Minor Update

Qwen3-30B-A3B recently released a minor update version called Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507. This efficient Mixture of Experts (MoE) model activates only 3B parameters while achieving performance close to GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking mode. Key improvements include:

- Enhanced reasoning, coding, and mathematical capabilities
- Expanded multilingual knowledge coverage
- Improved long-context understanding, supporting up to 256K tokens
- Better alignment with user intent and handling of open-ended tasks
- Removed <think> blocks for more direct and efficient responses

This update makes the model smarter, faster, and easier to deploy locally, suitable for various complex tasks such as instruction following, logical reasoning, and tool use.

> Commentary: Good news for open source and experimentation.

1. ChatGPT Study Mode

OpenAI today launched "Study Mode" for ChatGPT, a learning experience designed to help users work through problems step-by-step rather than providing direct answers. This mode uses guided questioning, step-by-step explanations, and interactive approaches to enhance critical thinking and learning outcomes, particularly useful for homework help, exam preparation, and exploring new knowledge.

The feature is now available to logged-in users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team tiers. ChatGPT Edu users will get access in the coming weeks. This update is seen as a responsible application of AI in education, aimed at reducing dependency on generative AI while promoting deeper learning.

> Commentary: The strongest AI product experience for average users. ChatGPT teaching you how to learn—sometimes you can't help but wonder if schools are still necessary.

2. NotebookLM & AI Mode Updates

Google recently announced major updates to NotebookLM, including Video Overviews and Studio panel upgrades.

Video Overviews serve as a visual alternative to Audio Overviews, generating AI-narrated slideshows that incorporate images, charts, quotes, and data from source documents. This helps users understand complex information more intuitively, with support for customizing topics, learning objectives, and target audiences. The Studio panel features a new interface design that supports creating and storing multiple outputs of the same type within a single notebook (such as multi-language audio or mind maps for different chapters), improving collaboration and multitasking efficiency. This feature is rolling out to English users, with more language support coming soon.

Additionally, for back-to-school season, Google Search's AI Mode received updates including: support for uploading images and PDF files on desktop browsers (with plans to expand to Google Drive and other file types), a Canvas tool for multi-session planning (like creating study guides), Search Live with integrated Google Lens for real-time video input, and Lens functionality in Chrome for asking questions about on-screen content. These enhancements aim to improve the learning experience for students, parents, and educators through interactive questioning, cross-referencing information, and visual context. Currently available mainly in the US and India for users 18 and older.

> Commentary: Google's product update blog posts don't mean features are immediately available—patience is required. Just like when AI Mode announced support for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Deep Research, users didn't get the feature on day one. NotebookLM is a great learning companion, and these updates further enhance learning assistance. AI Mode is a preview of Google disrupting itself—along with experimental projects like Web Guide, these experiments will eventually become Google Search products for the AI era.

3. Claude Code --add-dir Command

Claude Code recently introduced the --add-dir command, a feature extension that allows users to work across multiple directories in a single session. By using the CLI flag --add-dir <path> at startup or the slash command /add-dir <path> during a session, developers can seamlessly add additional working directories to Claude Code's workspace without switching the main directory. This update is particularly useful for working with monorepos, shared configurations, or cross-project collaboration, helping improve code navigation, referencing, and editing efficiency, making Claude Code an even more powerful and flexible terminal AI coding tool.

> Commentary: Claude Code has become the most popular product among developers. The cross-directory feature further elevates the experience. Anthropic deserves praise for developing products based on user needs.
